        <h2>The Truth About the Food Agency — I Know They Lied</h2>

          I'm writing this because I know — with complete certainty — that the National Food Agency and many similar health organizations have lied to the public.
          This is not speculation: it's an account of how institutional interests, corporate money and supply-security thinking shape the official narrative on food and health.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          "Why would the Food Agency lie?" — Because what they tell you protects systems and profits, not necessarily your health.

      <section class="section">
        <h3>My case, plainly stated</h3>
        <p>
          Everyone hears the same lines: cholesterol is dangerous, eat less meat, replace butter with vegetable oils. I know why that messaging persists.
          It isn't purely science-driven. It's driven by:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Economic inertia:</strong> If people suddenly refused cheap industrial oils, entire supply chains — from farmers to multinational processors — would collapse.</li>
          <li><strong>Corporate profit motives:</strong> Companies make more when they use cheap inputs like rapeseed/canola oil instead of butter. That creates incentives to fund research, lobby regulators, and influence public messaging.</li>
          <li><strong>Institutional risk management:</strong> Agencies prefer stable, conservative messaging that prevents panic and shortages — even if that means softening or misframing emerging evidence.</li>
          <li><strong>Funding and conflicts:</strong> Grants, partnerships and donations create loyalties that sway recommendations away from radical transparency.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout">
          This is not "maybe." I've seen the patterns too often: money, production, and political expediency override straightforward health messaging.
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h3>Concrete example — rapeseed/canola oil vs butter</h3>
        <p>
          Rapeseed oil is cheaper to produce and scale than butter. If the public learned that a widely sold cheap oil was substantially worse for long-term health, demand would crash.
          That would hurt farmers, processors and large food brands. So what happens instead? Messaging focuses on moderation and on population-level tradeoffs rather than calling out products by name.
        </p>

        <p>
          Meanwhile, manufacturers quietly increase the share of cheap oils in food products because the profit incentive is enormous. The result: foods that are marketed as "heart-healthy" or "cholesterol-friendly" can be engineered to be cheaper to make and more profitable — not necessarily healthier.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h3>Why official statements look scientific</h3>
        <p>
          Agencies often cite studies, reviews, and consensus reports. That's a smart strategy — it gives their messages the authority of science while allowing them to choose which studies count and which don't.
          Studies paid for by industry or shaped by industry-led research agendas make it easy to produce "consensus" that aligns with commercial interests.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h3>What I demand</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Full disclosure: all funding sources and conflicts of interest for advisory panels must be public and searchable.</li>
          <li>Independent replication: nutrition claims affecting millions must be replicated independently of industry funding.</li>
          <li>Accountability: if an agency's advisory materially favors an industry, there should be clear audits and public hearings.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h3>Author-supplied source</h3>
        <div class="refs">
          <p><strong>Provided citation:</strong> <em>The Big Food, Money Monopoly (PMC, 2025)</em>.</p>
          <p>Note: This is the source the author supplied. I cite it here because it supports the claims that corporate money shapes public food policy — but readers should verify the document themselves.</p>

      <section class="section">
        <h3>Short manifesto</h3>
        <p>
          I know this is true. I have watched how reports are framed, how phrases are chosen, and how inconvenient findings get buried or softened. When a recommendation protects a supply chain more than it protects people, that's not a mistake — it's a choice.
          This page exists to document that choice plainly and to call for transparency.
        </p>

        <pre>
Key claim: National food recommendations prioritize stability and industry interests as much as — or more than — raw public health.
Status: I assert this as truth.
Evidence: Author-supplied report (listed above); observable patterns in policy-making and corporate funding.
Action: Demand public audits, disclosure, and independent science.
